## Practice Statement - Medicine Tracker

**A medicine tracker app helps Nancy keep track of the days on which she has to take her medicine. Her physician has asked her to take a multivitamin after every 5 days. The app reminds her the number of days left for the medicine to be taken. Even if she misses a dose, and takes it a day after the calculated day or two, she still has the option to re-enter the day on which she had taken the medicine and the app starts tracking the next 5 days cycle from that day.**

**NOTE: The gap between the current date and the expected date should be indicated by the number of days. Also, consider leap years in this solution.**

***Hint :***
***The current day can be a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or a Sunday.***
***This must be represented as number 1 - Sunday, 2 - Monday, 3 - Tuesday, 4 - Wednesday, 5 - Thursday, 6 - Friday, and 7 - Saturday.***

**The gap between the current day and the expected date should be indicated with a number. Also, please consider leap years in this solution.**
